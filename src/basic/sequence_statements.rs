// Rust ignore blanks, tabs and line breaks, However, Rust programmers have the following
// habits that are recommended:
// 1 - to indent line by four spaces inside functions
// 2 - to avoid adding several consecutive spaces inside statements
// 3 - to avoid exceeding 80 columns, possibly splitting long statements on several lines
